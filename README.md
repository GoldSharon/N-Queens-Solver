# N-Queens-Solver

This Python script solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The user is prompted to enter the number of queens (N), and the script displays a solution or prints the board arrangement after placing the queens. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.
